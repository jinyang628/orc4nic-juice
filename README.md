Purpose of software
- Who is it for?
    - RC4 residents interested in making and drinking juice
- What can people do with it?
    - User Story
        - As an avid juice maker, I want to share my own recipes, bounce off ideas with other enthusiasts, and find like-minded friends to try out interesting concoctions with. 
        - As a juice lover, I want to know what juices are on sale.
    - Use Case
        - Forum section to facilitate conversation 
            - CRUD mechanics
            - Topic Tagging
        - Sales page to update potential buyers on what is on sale 

I am implementing a Rails backend. 

I hope to build 3 pages:
    - A home page where users get introduced to the the website and what ORC4NIC JUICE is involved in
    - A forum page where the user authentication and CRUD mechanics are implemented
    - A sales page which displays the item on sale that particular day, and links to a telegram bot where users can order the item.
